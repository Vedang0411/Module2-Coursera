Now a days because of Corona Pandemic many Humans are killed and many yet to be killed. In This picture Mother Earth is telling Corona virus to don’t hurt Humans despite of being hurt by us. Mother Earth provides every facility to humans then also we are polluting it and don’t understand its importance.  Earth is a beautiful living planet of the Universe. It is common home for all human beings and millions of species of plant and animals. Our Earth provide us with food, shelter all the requirements that we need to live a life. Despite this Facilities provided by Earth to humans, we are not even kind towards her. On the other hand, we show cruelty towards the Mother earth. Each day we produce lots of waste and pollution which degrade the quality of resources.  “We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.” Sooner or later, we will have to recognize that the earth has rights too, to live without pollution. What mankind must know is that human beings cannot live without Mother Earth, but the planet can live without humans.”

This picture conveys a message that ‘want what you need.’ Wants can change over a period of time. It gives a sense of satisfaction and pleasure on that day but it’s never ending. Needs remain constant throughout the life time.  As we grow, our wants convert to needs sometimes we realize that when we thought we needed was only a want. Most of us fail to understand what we really need and our thoughts are controlled by what we want. Gradually our actions are controlled by our “fake” desires and when we realize what we actually need, it’s too late.  Instead of thinking about wants that are never ending we should focus on our needs and work on it. Sometimes we are so focused on what we want, we miss the things we need.

Prices will vary with the size of the station and newspaper. Paid advertising may be necessary to provide important information and to persuade behavior or attitude changes.
